title: Looking for a Student House Inclusive of All Bills?
author: Phil

When we purchased 66 Sherwin Road in the summer of 2015, we found that the students who were about to move in for the 2015/16 academic year had signed a _bills excluded_ contract with the former owners.

While the students seemed okay with the arrangement, it did create challenges for them (and us) around the uncertainty about how much things were going to cost, how they should split the bills, and who to contact to organise the transfer of things like broadband and gas/electricity. There was also uncertainty about whether they should buy a TV licence for the house or just take their chances and hope they didn't get detected!

Our view is that it's stressful enough going to university and trying to find a decent house to live in. The last thing you want to be worrying about when you arrive is how long it will take to get your broadband set up and whether you are allowed to watch TV! More importantly, you want to be able to turn the heating on if it gets cold without worrying about which utility provider to go with or how to get a reasonable deal.

We decided to take all of this pain away and only let the house on an all-inclusive basis. We want students (and their parents) to be able to connect to the Wi-Fi as soon as they arrive at the house. We want everyone to have the ability to watch TV without worry, and we want everyone to stay nice and warm in those cold winter months without worrying about bills! We also make sure that the garden is maintained (monthly gardening service is included, too, of course) so that the house feels a bit more loved and a bit more like a home.

But it doesn't end there. We decided to take the all-inclusive mantra beyond just bills by providing a starter pack of all the basic things you might need. Things like dishwasher tablets, washing powder, toilet rolls, kitchen rolls, cleaning essentials, and a wide range of cutlery, crockery, pots, pans, and bath mats. We even include a brand new unopened mattress protector in each bedroom at the start of each year.

Any student renting 66 Sherwin Road can expect a fantastic house that is brilliantly equipped and is maintained and managed without any uncertainty about what it's going to cost. Moreover, our all-inclusive rental contract is only for 48 weeks rather than the usual 52, which offers a huge saving!

We usually begin marketing the house in November but if you would like to express your interest now then you can do so by emailing us at <hello@66sherwinroad.co.uk> or through our [contact form](/contact).
