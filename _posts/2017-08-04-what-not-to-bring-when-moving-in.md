title: What Not to Bring When Moving In
author: Phil
---
Our philosophy is to make moving in to our student house at 66 Sherwin Road as pleasant and as easy as possible. We want you to be excited to arrive and we don't want you (or your parents) stressed out about what you need to bring with you and how you're going to get it here (and home again at the end of the year)!

Our focus at the start of each academic year is to make sure that the house is as welcoming and as comfortable as possible. We'll ensure that it's super clean, we'll provide all the essentials, and of course, we'll ensure that the Wi-Fi is working from the minute you enter the house.

There is no point, for example, for each of you to bring a toaster or your own set of cutlery, because whilst the kitchen is big it cannot accommodate six of everything and it would be a waste of your money. We also appreciate that not everyone will be able to come by car and that those travelling by train or coach need to be able to travel light!

### What not to pack...

With all of the above in mind, we have put together the following list of all the items that we supply in the house at the start of each academic year:

#### In each bedroom:

### What you _do_ need to bring...

Things you will need to bring in addition to your clothes, study material and other personal items:
- bedding (pillows, sheets, duvet, blankets etc.)
- towels

If anyone is travelling by train and will struggle to bring bedding or would simply prefer for us to supply these items then we can. All items will be brand new (unopened) and left out for you on arrival, at a cost of Â£100 per person. You will receive:
- luxury pillows (2)
- bedsheet
- duvet (13.5 tog)
- duvet cover

- towels (1 large & 1 small)

If you would like this, we need to know by the **1st of July**.
