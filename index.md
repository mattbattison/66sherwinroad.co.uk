66 Sherwin Road is a stylish and popular six-bed student house with all-inclusive rent, located on a quiet street in the heart of Lenton, Nottingham.

The house is a lovely Victorian property. It's light and spacious with many original features, high ceilings, and six good-sized bedrooms. As well as the large kitchen/diner, there is a separate lounge complete with a 55-inch HD smart TV and Virgin 360 TV box offering hundreds of TV channels.

Additionally, Virgin Gig1 ultrafast broadband is available throughout the house with Virgin Wi-Fi Pods in place to ensure every room gets a great signal. In the heated cellar there is a fully-equipped laundry room (Miele and Bosch Washers and Dryers) and extra storage space for your personal belongings.

All bills are included (gas, electricity, water, broadband, and TV licence) so once you've paid your rent there is nothing to worry about other than food and drink. We provide an extensive range of pots, pans, utensils, crockery, cutlery, and glasses, as well as bath mats and a starter pack of essentials like cleaning spray, tea towels, toilet roll, tea & coffee, and more — see below for a full list. The garden is even maintained on a regular basis at no extra cost!

The location is excellent. It's within easy reach of the QMC and the University of Nottingham, it's a short walk to the local bus stops and tram routes into the city, and there are plenty of local shops, gyms, and take-away restaurants nearby including a Tesco Express, Lidl, and a large Sainsbury's.

We purchased the house in the summer of 2015 and since then it has benefitted from a series of major improvements including an amazing new kitchen, new appliances, new beds, new mattresses (2021), new carpets (2022), new furniture in every room, re-decoration throughout, new double glazing, a new CCTV and alarm system, secure (covered) bike storage and a lovely garden with outside seating and a BBQ. There is also off-street parking for one car with further on-street parking available via a resident permit.

In 2018 we upgraded both bathrooms and installed a larger and more efficient boiler to ensure every room is nice and warm in the winter and to make sure there is always lots of hot water for the showers!
